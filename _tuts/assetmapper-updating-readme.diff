-**OPTIONAL: Webpack Encore Assets**
-
-This app uses Webpack Encore for the CSS, JS and image files.
-But, the built files are already included... so you don't need
-to download or build anything if you don't want to!
-
-But if you *do* want to play with the CSS/JS and build the
-final files, no problem. Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
-or `npm` installed (`npm` comes with Node) and then run:
-
-```
-yarn install
-yarn encore dev --watch
-
-# or
-npm install
-npm run watch
-```
