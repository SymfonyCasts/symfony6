# Upgrading & What's in Symfony 7

Well hi there! This repository holds the code and script for the
[Upgrading & What's in Symfony 7](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfony7-upgrade)
course on SymfonyCasts.

## Setup

If you've just downloaded the code, congratulations!!

To get it working, follow these steps:

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Webpack Encore Assets**

This app uses Webpack Encore for the CSS, JS and image files.
But, the built files are already included... so you don't need
to download or build anything if you don't want to!

But if you *do* want to play with the CSS/JS and build the
final files, no problem. Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
or `npm` installed (`npm` comes with Node) and then run:

```
yarn install
yarn encore dev --watch

# or
npm install
npm run watch
```

**Start the Symfony web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but Symfony's local web server
works even better.

To install the Symfony local web server, follow
"Downloading the Symfony client" instructions found
here: https://symfony.com/download - you only need to do this
once on your system.

Then, to start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
project, and run:

```
symfony serve
```

(If this is your first time using this command, you may see an
error that you need to run `symfony server:ca:install` first).

Now check out the site at `https://localhost:8000`

Have fun!

## Have Ideas, Feedback or an Issue?

If you have suggestions or questions, please feel free to open an issue
